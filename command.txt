I am using ros2 jazzy with gazebo harmonic, and I have a (ros2_ws) with a directory (src/unitree_go2_ros2). 

The src/unitree_go2_ros2 directory is a simulation for Unitree go2 robot with (5) packages, and they are:

* champ
* champ_base
* champ_msgs 
* unitree_go2_description
* unitree_go2_sim

To Run the go2 simulation system, we run (ros2 launch unitree_go2_sim unitree_go2_launch.py). 

The (5) packages are used as following:

- unitree_go2_description -> Contains the xacro file for the robot (go2)
- unitree_go2_sim -> Contains the launch file to run the system, and the config file - Core controllers and state estimation for CHAMP (You Must Check it)
- champ & champ_base -> Contains the controller part of the system
- champ_msgs -> cont the messages

So, the catch here is that the (unitree_go2_launch.py) launch file does not support the (namespace), where I want to add a (namespace) to the launch file to support the mutli-robot sim (Go2). 

To acheive that, we need to modify the entire system, and the system is complicated, so you have to be cearful with that. 

See all the changes that must be done to achive that.  

the task is that making the unitree system work with (namespace)

Help me with this task, and 

YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE:  
- Go through the entire (src/unitree_go2_ros2) directory files to make sure that the changes are done properlly, and understand 100% how the system work before doing anything. 
- Everytime you modify the codes, and want to test the launch file, you need to build the entire workspace (colcon build), then source it (source install/setup.bash). 
- Don't test the system, I will tell you if I want you test it, I will test it by myself
- Make sure that the controller_manager is  subscribing to the correct topic (the one with namespace).
- Check these two node quadruped_controller_node - state_estimation_node that have namespace as well.
- Make sure that you check the (hip) & (upper_leg) in the xacro to ensure the namespace
- Check the (links_config.yaml) file as well
- Check ros2_control plugin namespace configuration
- Don't assume anything, tell me what you want to know 
- Check the sensores xacro file for the namespace
- first run the system with one robot to make sure that the namespace is working 
- Do some research and search for your work that you are sure 100% you gave me the correct solutions 
- Check these files links.yaml and joints.yaml
- Make sure that you are aware of my setup, to help me with the correct answers 
- Double check your workm before doing any changes in the code.
- Take your time to think and analyis.
- Make sure that we kill all the ros2 and gz processes before reruning the test of the system (launch file)
