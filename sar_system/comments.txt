Here is the issue, 

I have a launch file where it runs to robots (go2) & (drone). (sar_system/launch/sar_system.launch.py)

the launch file is running the two robots in one gz enviroment. 

The issue is that some of the (TFs) od the robots has conflicets, and this causes issues for the sim. 

I have the TF tree for both robots indivisually, and they are 

sar_system/drone_tf_tree.png - Drone TF tree

&

sar_system/go2_tf_tree.png - Go2 TF tree

Also, I have the tf tree for the sar system in (sar_system/sar_tf_tree.png) - SAR TF tree

I want you to do the following 

1- Check the Drone TF tree image and analyis it and understand it 
2- Check the Go2 TF tree image and analyis it and understand it
3- Check the SAR TF tree image and analyis it and understand it
4- Go through the (sar_system/launch/sar_system.launch.py) launch file & understand it
